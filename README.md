## Project Intensions

In this Brick Breaker project, my primary focus is on delivering a Minimal Valuable Product with clean, maintainable code. I am using a to-do list to plan and track my progress, ensuring a structured approach to development. This project serves as a platform for me to enhance my skills and deepen my understanding of Unity and C#, with an emphasis on best practices and efficient coding techniques.

## Usage

Left mouse button to throw a ball. The arrow keys or "A" and "D" to control the paddle. 
The goal is to break all the bricks without letting the ball touch the bottom of the screen. 

## Features

- [X] **Functional Paddle**: The player can control the paddle's horizontal movement.
- [X] **Functional Ball**: The ball moves and bounces off walls and the paddle.
- [X] **Brick Destruction**: The ball destroys bricks upon collision.
- [X] **Scoring System**: Keep track of the player's score.
- [X] **Lives System**: Implement a basic lives system.
- [X] **Minimal Sound Effects**
