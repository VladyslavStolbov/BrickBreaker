# BrickBreaker

BrickBreaker is a classic arcade game built with Unity. The player controls a paddle to bounce a ball and break bricks. The game includes a scoring system and a lives system.

## Project Intensions

This project was created with the intention of building a clone game with a focus on clear, well-structured code. It served as a practical exercise to improve my Unity and general coding skills. The goal was not only to create a functional game but also to ensure that the code behind it is clean, efficient, and well-organized.


## Features

- [X] **Functional Paddle**: The player can control the paddle's horizontal movement.
- [X] **Functional Ball**: The ball moves and bounces off walls and the paddle.
- [X] **Brick Destruction**: The ball destroys bricks upon collision.
- [X] **Scoring System**: Keep track of the player's score.
- [X] **Lives System**: Implement a basic lives system.
- [X] **Minimal Sound Effects**

## Usage

Use the arrow keys or "A" and "D" to control the paddle. The goal is to break all the bricks without letting the ball touch the bottom of the screen.
